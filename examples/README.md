# MLC-Seq Examples

### Description
Examples illustrate the usage of MLC-Seq algorithms (implemented as modules, you can find them under <em>modules</em> folder).

### Examples
#### Example 1. Exploring Yeast tRNA-Phe (Short Version)
The notebook <em>trna_phe_analysis_lite.ipynb</em> is a short version you can run and get the result in 1 minute. If you don't have much time, but still want to experience MLC-Seq, this notebook is right for you.

#### Example 2. Exploring Yeast tRNA-Phe (Standard Version)
The notebook <em>trna_phe_analysis.ipynb</em> is a standard version illustrate how to explore a typical sample we described in our paper. Please note that when we do data analysis on any unknown samples, including the samples we dealt with in our paper, the process is not fully automated. Sometimes, manual work may still need to be involved in several steps of the MLC-Seq workflow. For example, manually ladder separation, inspecting the results of MassSum/GapFill, and identifying the results Ladder Complementation, etc.

### Run the Example
1. Choose a notebook(.ipynb) and click on it. The system will open it on a new web page.
2. In the opened notebook, you will notice that it is constituted with several cells. Each cell contains one or more lines of code. To run a cell(run the code inside), click inside that cell, then click either the 'Run' button from the toolbar in the top area of the web page or the "Run Cells and Select Below" button from the menu "Cell".
3. To run the entire notebook, please run all the cells one by one from top to bottom.

Please note that some cells might consume more time to run than others. You can see whether the code is still being executed or not. There will be a small circle in the top right corner that stays blinking until the execution of code completes. After a cell is executed, the outputs will show up right below that cell.
